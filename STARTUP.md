## Step 1: Start Claude Code
**What we're doing:** Launching Claude Code in interactive mode.  
**Why:** This is the primary way you'll interact with Claude for coding tasks.

**Action:** Open a **new** terminal — click the **+** at the top right of the terminal panel, or use *Terminal → New Terminal*. Then type:
```bash
claude
```

> **Why a new terminal?** VS Code gives a terminal its environment only at the moment that terminal is created, and the terminal the codespace opens for you may be created *before* the Claude Code extension finishes starting up. A terminal opened after that point reliably picks up what Claude Code needs to show its side-by-side diff view inside the editor. If you forget, the labs still work.

You may see a welcome message and some update information.

> **First run:** Claude Code may ask *"Try the new fullscreen renderer?"*. Choose **2. Not now** — the screenshots in these labs show the standard view.

## Step 2: Login
**What we're doing:** Running the */login* command in Claude Code.  
**Why:** We haven't authenticated yet.

**Action:** Hit *Enter* to dismiss the welcome message if needed. In Claude Code at the prompt, type:
```
/login
```

![login](./images/cc2.png?raw=true "login")

## Step 3: Authenticate Your Account
**What we're doing:** Connecting Claude Code to your Anthropic account.  
**Why:** Authentication enables full features and personalized settings.

**Action:** When prompted, follow the authentication flow:

### a. For *Select login method:*, choose option 1 (either type "1" or select the line and hit "Enter") - *Claude account with subscription*
<br>

![subscription](./images/ccode80.png?raw=true "Subscription")

<br><br>

### b. Claude will display a URL and code. We won't be able to open this, so just click on *Cancel*. 
<br>

![url popup](./images/ccode81.png?raw=true "URL popup")

<br><br>

### c. Back in the codespace screen, open the full URL displayed there - either by *Ctrl/Cmd+click* or by copying and pasting the URL into a browser tab.
<br>

![backup method](./images/ccode82.png?raw=true "backup method") 

<br><br>


### d. You *may* have to sign in with your userid again and get a verification code to use before going to the next steps. If so, just follow the prompts and make sure to authenticate in the SAME browser as the one where you opened the URL.

![login](./images/cc3.png?raw=true "login") 

<br><br>

### e. On the next screen that is shown, click on the *Authorize* button to give Claude Code authorization to use your Claude chat account.
<br>

![auth dialog](./images/ccode16.png?raw=true "auth dialog") 

<br><br>

### f. Next, you should see a screen with an authentication code. Click on the *Copy Code* link at the bottom to copy the authentication code.
<br>

![authentication code](./images/ccode18.png?raw=true "authentication code") 

<br><br>

### g. Go back to the codespace. In the area in the terminal under the URL, you should see a prompt like *Paste code here if prompted*. Click next to that and paste in the authentication code you copied in the previous step.
<br>

![Paste code](./images/ccode19.png?raw=true "Paste code") 

<br><br>

### h. After this, you should see an indication that login was successful, press *Enter* and you are ready to use Claude Code!
<br>

![successful login](./images/ccode83.png?raw=true "Successful login") 

<br><br>

## Step 4: Ensure the Sonnet model is selected
**What we're doing:** Running the */model* command in Claude Code.  
**Why:** Use a cheaper model since we're doing simple tasks.

**Action:** In Claude Code at the prompt, type:
```
/model
```
In the list that comes up, if the default doesn't already have Sonnet selected, use the arrow keys to move the pointer to the *Sonnet* entry (usually "4") and hit *Enter*. 

Separately, use the left/right arrow keys to change the effort to *Medium effort*. (The exact model versions listed may differ from the screenshot — pick the current Sonnet model.)

![model selection](./images/ccode243.png?raw=true "model selection")

You should see an indicator that the model was set to *Sonnet* with *medium* effort. Note: your `/model` selection is saved as the default for new sessions; hit `Enter` in the model list to set it as your default.

<br><br>

## Step 5: Make sure you're in auto mode
**What we're doing:** Checking the permission mode, and switching it if needed.  
**Why:** The labs assume *auto mode* — and a brand-new Codespace does not start there.

**Action:** Look at the bottom-left of the Claude Code prompt.

- If it reads `⏵⏵ auto mode on` — you're set.
- If it reads `⏸ manual mode on` — press **Shift+Tab** until it reads `⏵⏵ auto mode on`.

Claude Code normally starts in **auto mode** on Pro, Max and Team plans. The exception is the
**first** session after a fresh install — and a brand-new Codespace counts as one — which starts in
**manual**. Later sessions pick up auto on their own, so this is usually a one-time step.

<br><br>

### You're now ready for the labs!
